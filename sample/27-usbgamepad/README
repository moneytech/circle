README

This sample displays the controls of an attached USB gamepad. On start-up an
information about the available controls (buttons, axes and hats) is shown and
later, when you push a button or move an axis or hat, the current state of all
controls is displayed.

Circle supports gamepads with standard USB HID class report interface (3-0-0)
and some widespread branded gamepads with proprietary USB interfaces. This
simple sample works with all of these supported gamepads, while
sample/37-showgamepad shows the gamepad controls more easy to survey, but does
work with some known gamepads only.

There are also USB gamepads out, which support the standard USB HID class report
interface but do not have a fully qualified report descriptor. It is likely that
their support is limited to some gamepad controls.
